This website was made for my personal use.
My laptop is an ordinary one with 4 GB RAM and I3 processor. So using a lot of applications was pretty difficult.
I used to use vlc media and chrome at the same time. VLC to listen music and chrome to browse the internet. But it used to took way out of my RAM. Just using these two used to take approx 800 of my RAM. So I made this website to use it in chrome and browse the internet at the same time. It takes comparatively less RAM than the last one.
