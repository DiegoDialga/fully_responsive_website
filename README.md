# Responsive_website
This website was made for my personal use.
My laptop is an ordinary one with 4 GB RAM and I3 processor. So using a lot of applications was pretty difficult.
I used to use vlc media and chrome at the same time. VLC to listen music and chrome to browse the internet. But it used to take way out of my RAM. Just using these two used to take approx 800 of my RAM. So I made this website to use it in chrome and browse the internet at the same time. It takes comparatively less RAM than the last one.
Songs cannot be added to this, since it will become a pretty big file. This folder only contains the source code for the websites and the pictures that I used in the webpages.
